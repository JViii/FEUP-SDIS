register - bind DNS name to IP, return -1 if already registered, number of bindings in the service otherwise
lookup - retrieve IP from DNS. Returns 'x.x.x.x' or 'NOT_FOUND' string

* Use table with pairs (DNS name, IP address)

Server must respond to:
  * Registration of plate number and its owner
  * Query of the owner of given plate number
  ''REGISTER <DNS name> <IP address>''
  ''LOOKUP <DNS name>

Possible reply
  <result> (this should be the integer -1 or number of DNS names already registered)
  <DNS name> <IP address>

Note: To simplify, each message should be a string


Server: 
  Usage: java Server <port number> (infinite loop)

    <oper> - operation received
    <opnd>* - list of operands received

  When a connection happens print message
    Server: <oper> <opnd>*
    
Client:
  java Client <host> <port> <oper> <opnd>*

  <host> - DNS name or IP address
  <port> - port number of server's service
  <oper> - 'register' or 'lookup'
  <opnd>* - list of operands

  Client waits after sending request, prints the reply and terminates
    Client: <oper> <opnd>* : <result>

    <result> should be 'ERROR' if any errors occur


Extra: implement timeout on client?

Examples:
  javac Client.java && java Client localhost 5454 register www.google.com 8.8.8.8
  javac Server.java && java Server 5454
